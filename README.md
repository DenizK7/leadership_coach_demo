# Interview Demo Project

[Live Demo](https://deniz-ai.up.railway.app/)

Welcome to the Interview Demo Project! This project was created as part of a technical interview to demonstrate a multi-component solution built using Flask and Streamlit. The solution is organized into two separate directories—**backend** and **frontend**—each with its own dependencies and startup procedures.

## Overview

This demo project is a conversational AI application that leverages modern technologies to provide an interactive experience. The backend is implemented with Flask, while the frontend uses Streamlit for a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Demo Video

## Technologies Used

- **OpenAI GPT-4 Mini:** A streamlined version of the GPT-4 model for generating natural language responses.
- **ElevenLabs Conversational AI:** Provides conversational capabilities to the application.
- **Flask:** Serves as the backend framework.
- **Streamlit:** Used to build the frontend interface.
- **FAISS:** Employed for efficient similarity search in high-dimensional data.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:

- **backend:** Contains the Flask application.
- **frontend:** Contains the Streamlit application.

## Setup Instructions

### Backend (Flask)

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    flask run


### Frontend (Streamlit)

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py

### Deployment
This project is deployed using Railway for quick and efficient cloud deployment. For more details on deployment, please refer to the Railway Documentation.
